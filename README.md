# Micro-level-Corporate-Financial-Summary-Data

The creation of this large dataset was motivated by the desire to gain a deeper understanding of corporate employee welfare programs and the lack of open datasets in India. This dataset consists of 1073 audited financial statements and annual return reports filed under the Income Tax Act and the Companies Act between April 2003 and March 2022. Datasets such as this can be used to learn about credit bureau ratings, employee size and other employment related information. In order to ensure that the dataset represents an ideal sample size, we also added reports under existing labor laws and other employee welfare laws, such as the Provident Fund Act, Pension Scheme, Gratuity Act.
